    "- Probability samples: Each member of the population has a non-zero probabilty of being selected. It is done randomly. E.g. random, systematic and stratified sampling\n",
    "- Non Probability samples: Memebrs are selected from the population in a non random way. It is biased and opinion-based E.g. convenience, judgement, Quota and Snowball sampling.\n",

    "Probability Samples \n",
    "- Random sampling: Each member has equal probability of getting selected.\n",
    "- Systematic sampling: Every Nth record is selected in the sample. N should be random and fixed interval should be there.\n",
    "- Stratified sampling: Identify suitable stratum in the data. Then use random sampling in each stratum\n",
    "- Cluster sampling \n",

    "Non-Probability Samples\n",
    "- Convenience Sampling: A sample is selected because it is convenient to select. Used in initial studies that would involve less cost. E.g. Survey - Facebook polls or questions. \n",
    " \n",
    "- Judgement Sampling A sample is selected through judgements - no random experiments. The researcher is sure of the sample being representative of the population - Expect opinion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quota Sampling: Identify the stratum and their proportion. Then use convenience or judgement sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Snowball Sampling: Used when the elements are hard to locate. Sample is rare to find. Initial elements selected in the sample refer for elements with similar traits."
